This directory contains the results of running the 88 DataRaceBench
experiments on an M1 MacBook Pro (4+4 cores) with 16GB RAM.  They were
generated by executing:

  make >summary.txt

Total runtime was 1176 seconds (approximately 20 minutes).

The results show that in all but 3 cases, the expected result (race or
no race) is obtained.  This can be seen by searching for "PASS" or
"FAIL" in summary.txt.

An individual test can be executed by

  make foo

where foo.c is the name of the source file.
