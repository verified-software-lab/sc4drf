This directory contains the results of running the 88 DataRaceBench
experiments on an M1 MacBook Pro (4+4 cores) with 16GB RAM.  They were
generated by executing:

  make >summary.txt

Total runtime was approximately 30 minutes.

The results show that in all but 3 cases, the expected result (race or
no race) is obtained.  This can be seen by searching for "PASS" or
"FAIL" in summary.txt.

An individual test can be executed by

  make foo

where foo.c is the name of the source file.

The problems can also be run at a smaller scale by editing the
Makefile.  You may change NTHREAD from its current value of 8 to
something else.  This is the upper bound on the number of threads
in an OpenMP parallel region.

You may change BOUND from its current value of 10 to something else.
This is an upper bound on the input N to a program.

Note the last 3 "misc." problems have their own bounds and do not use
the NTHREAD and BOUND variables.
